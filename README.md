# Intern-Project-KMBL-
This is my summer intern project at KMBL
The problem was to increase the net banking or mobile banking users
So we took a dataset of users who were not using NB/MB for three months and started using NB/MB in the next two months.
I started working on that dataset and then did all the processes like data cleaning, data preprocessing(encoding), feature selection, and model building.
I selected XGBoost as a final model and got results that one can see in my jupyter notebook.
Explained details are in jupyter notebook.

If someone sees any error or has any recommendations for this project please let me know
